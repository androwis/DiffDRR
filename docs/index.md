title: `DiffDRR` - Auto-differentiable digitally reconstructed radiographs in PyTorch
---

# Getting Started

`DiffDRR` is a differentiable rendering package for simulating X-rays from CT scans.
It is implemented as an auto-differentiable, GPU-accelerated PyTorch module, fully integrable in deep learning pipelines.
